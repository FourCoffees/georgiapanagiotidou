I am looking to recruit motivated PhD students to work with me in the Human Centred Computing group at King's. I am keen to work with PhD students interested in projects in HCI, data visualisation/physicalisation and sustainability. Look at my publications to get an idea of my interests.

Contact me for funding options.

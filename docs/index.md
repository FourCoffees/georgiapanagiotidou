I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Informatics at Kingâ€™s College London. My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), data visualization and sustainability. Overall, I focus on how people engage with data, particularly within interdisciplinary domains like sustainability, exploring key challenges such as biases, uncertainties, and friction in collective data use.

My work often employs participatory methods, utilizing 'technology probes' to better understand how individuals and communities interact with data. Currently, I am working on human-centred technologies that enable communities to pursue Net-Zero goals, blending participatory design with data science to develop practical tools for community-driven sustainability. My latest project investigates the environmental impact of machine learning from the perspective of the interfaces developers and end-users experience (see also  Publications).

Before returning to academia, I worked in the field of data design and journalism, contributing to the data team of _Helsingin Sanomat_, the largest daily newspaper in Finland, as well as to multiple NGOs including the Open Knowledge Foundation Finland where I developed data visualizations that reached wide audiences.

<!-- My research examines how people interact with data and specifically how they handle issues such as biases, uncertainties and frictions when using data visualizations. I am also increasingly interested in topics surrounding sustainability and climate justice, especially as they relate to data and AI systems. -->

My research interests include:

- Human-computer Interaction
- Sustainability and Ecofeedback
- Enviromental Impact of ML
- Data Visualisation and Physicalisation
